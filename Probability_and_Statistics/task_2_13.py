'''
Bayes' theorem applied

P(A|B)= P(B|A)â‹… P(A) / P(B)

Imagine you're testing for a rare disease,
and producent claims that the test is 95% accurate,
meaning that if you have a disease,
you will test positive 95% of the time and if yopu don't you will test negative 95% of the time.
Assuming that 0.5% of the population has the disease and someone tests positive.
What's the probability that the person is sick?

# 1. Simulate who has the disease

# If sick => 95% chance of positive test
# If healthy => 5% chance of false positive

# 3. Count true positives (people who are both sick and tested positive)
true_positives = np.sum(test_positive & has_disease)
total_positives = np.sum(test_positive)

# 4. Compute P(sick | positive test)
